# MiniProject
Work I did in my mini project course in my 2nd year in IIEST Shibpur. Batch 2019 - 2023.
* This is a 2 semsters project.
* Main objective is to segment characters of Bengali scripts.
* For that I used a special image format .PBM which is not regular.
* Used techniques like binarization of an image, connected component labelling of a binary image.
* Used operations like morphological image processing.
* With the help of the above methods I acheived the main objective which is character segmentation.
