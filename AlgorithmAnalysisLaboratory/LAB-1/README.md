# LAB 1

The tasks of the this labaratory session are the following: - 
<li>Generate data sets of both normal and uniform distributions upto 1 million data points.
<li>Implement Merge sort, Quick sort and Randomized quick sort on both the distributions and obtain their average time complexity.
<li>Then normalize all the data sets, so that every data point lies between 0 and 1 (like MinMaxScaler in python's sckit learn library).
<li>Now implement Bucket sort on both the distributions and obtain it's average time complexity.
<li>Implement Median of medians selection algorithm to find kth smallest element in the data set and use different partition splits of 3/5/7...etc and comment on the time taken by using different type partitions.
